Twitter Analytics Dashboard Using Power BI


Objective:
The purpose of this project is to analyze tweet performance data using Power BI and derive insights based on dynamic filters, engagement metrics, and time-based conditions. The dataset contains fields like tweet content, engagement metrics (likes, replies, retweets, media views/engagements), and timestamps. Three key visualizations were to be developed using advanced filtering and dynamic visibility based on current time (IST).

Task Overview:


Task 1:

Develop a chart that displays tweets with the highest engagement rates (Top 10%), filtered by:

More than 50 likes
Character count < 30
Tweet posted on a weekday
Time between 3 PM and 5 PM IST only
Tweets should not be shown outside the specified time slot


Task 2:

Plot a scatter chart to analyze the relationship between media engagements and media views, filtered by:

Tweets with more than 10 replies
Tweet date should be an odd day
Word count > 50
Engagement rate > 5% should be highlighted
Time between 6 PM and 11 PM IST only

Task 3:

Create a visualization that compares replies, retweets, and likes, filtered by:

Tweets with media engagements above median
Posted between June and August 2020
Time between 7 AM–11 AM or 3 PM–5 PM IST
Tweet date should be odd-numbered
Media views should be even
Character count should be above 20
Tweet should not contain the letter 'S'
